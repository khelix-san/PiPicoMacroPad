# PiPicoMacroPad
Just a simple yet "efficient" code for a macro pad built with a raspberry py pico

This is simple code made by me to minimize the size of the .py file loaded onto the board.
There is a better way to implement this code, I am sure, and here you are free to modify or update it

SETUP AND INSTALLATION:
The first time you'll connect your pi pico to you pc, it will show as an external drive.
You will only have to drag the <b>.uf2</b> file also posted in my repo.
(you can also look for the latest version here: https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)
  
After the file is on the pico, it will reboot on its own and you will see some files and folders on it

You now just have to copy the file <b>pad.py</b> on it.
IMPORTANT: 
<ul>
  <li>In the code set the GP numbers in correspondence of the button connection on your pico</li>
  <li>You are free to change names and delcare new ones (functions too) as i did (just follow my comments in the code)</li>
  <li><b>In order to autostart the script, the file must be renamed main.py</b></li>
  <li><b>Copy the content of the lib folder provided by the prepo into your pico lib folder</b></li>
</ul>
